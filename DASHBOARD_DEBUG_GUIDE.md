# Dashboard Debug Guide

## ‚úÖ **Issue Fixed!**

The dashboard loading issue has been resolved. Here's what was fixed:

### **üîß Root Cause**
The dashboard.html and fullapp.html files were referencing `/src/main.tsx` instead of the built JavaScript assets, causing them to fail loading in the Chrome extension environment.

### **üõ†Ô∏è Solution Implemented**

1. **Post-Build Script**: Created `scripts/fix-extension-assets.js`
   - Automatically extracts asset references from built index.html
   - Updates dashboard.html and fullapp.html with correct asset paths
   - Runs after every build

2. **Updated Build Process**: Modified package.json scripts
   - `npm run build` now includes the asset fixing step
   - `npm run build:extension` for explicit extension builds

3. **Correct Asset References**: Dashboard now loads:
   ```html
   <script type="module" crossorigin src="/assets/vendor--0RGCJ5T.js"></script>
   <script type="module" crossorigin src="/assets/ui-BgJCN8aH.js"></script>
   <script type="module" crossorigin src="/assets/router-CkB1M-tf.js"></script>
   <script type="module" crossorigin src="/assets/main-B6ZClLxd.js"></script>
   <link rel="stylesheet" crossorigin href="/assets/main-CA0ZS6Bq.css">
   ```

### **üß™ Testing Steps**

#### **1. Rebuild the Extension**
```bash
npm run build
```

#### **2. Reload Extension in Chrome**
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find your Focus Timer extension
3. Click the reload button (üîÑ)

#### **3. Test Dashboard Access**
1. Click the extension icon in Chrome toolbar
2. Click "Dashboard" button in popup
3. Should open new tab with full dashboard interface
4. URL should be: `chrome-extension://[id]/dashboard.html#/dashboard`

#### **4. Test Full App Access**
1. Click "Analytics" button in popup
2. Should open new tab with full application
3. URL should be: `chrome-extension://[id]/fullapp.html#/fullapp`

### **üîç Debugging Tips**

#### **If Dashboard Still Won't Load:**

1. **Check Browser Console**
   - Open dashboard tab
   - Press F12 ‚Üí Console tab
   - Look for JavaScript errors

2. **Verify Asset Loading**
   - In Console, check if all assets loaded successfully
   - Look for 404 errors on asset files

3. **Check Extension Permissions**
   - Ensure extension has proper permissions
   - Try reloading the extension

4. **Test Hash Routing**
   - Manually navigate to: `chrome-extension://[id]/dashboard.html#/dashboard`
   - Should load the dashboard interface

#### **Common Issues & Solutions:**

1. **Blank Page**
   - Usually means JavaScript errors
   - Check console for error messages
   - Verify all assets are loading

2. **404 Errors on Assets**
   - Re-run `npm run build`
   - Check that post-build script ran successfully
   - Verify asset filenames match in HTML

3. **Hash Routing Not Working**

   - Check that hash is set correctly in HTML files
